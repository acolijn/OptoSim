# Just some useful info on submitting jobs

- Submitting 100 jobs to the cluster for simulations, each with 10k events between 100 and 10k photons. It will take around 5hours in energy log scale and around 20 hours in linear energy scale (more photons -> more time). It will use no more than 250MB of RAM. 

- Submitting the jobs for the training, it will take around 1 hour for the log scale and 4 hours for the linear scale. It will use up to ~12GB of RAM.
