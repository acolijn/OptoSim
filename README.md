# OptoSim

OptoSim is a Python package for optical simulation of a TPC and for position reconstruction with machine learning. It provides a set of tools for simulating the propagation of light through a scintillator material and the subsequent detection of the scintillation light by a photodetector. The package also includes a set of machine learning models using super-resolution for reconstructing the position of the scintillation event from the detected light.

## Installation

You can install OptoSim using pip:

```bash
pip install optosim
```

## Usage
Here's an example of how to use OptoSim:

```python

import optosim

# Your code here
